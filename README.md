In this repo I created nuxt 3 project with custom router.options for subdomain and dynamic pages based on dynamic subdomain as well.
for example you can rich to subdomain1.host.com -> redirect you to folder -> pages->subdomain1->index.vue
and also with entering url : subdomain1.host.com/about -> redirect you to folder -> pages->subdomain1->about.vue
